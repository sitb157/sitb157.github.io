:raising_hand: Hi! Nice to meet you!!!  
I’m a software engineer researching AI models for edge device-based autonomous driving.  
Previously, I developed autonomous navigation systems using ROS/ROS2, focusing on multi-robot collaboration and path optimization.  
Currently, I’m working on AI technology that enables autonomous vehicles to perceive their environment and navigate optimally on edge devices.
